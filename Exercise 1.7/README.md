# Exercise 1.7

In this final Exercise, you’ll finalize your Recipe app using a method known as object relational mapping. Incorporating this tool into your Python script will let you interact with your database in a new, object-oriented way, meaning you don’t have to memorize SQL syntax between different DBMSs.

You’ll first learn more about what an object-relational mapper is and the advantages of using it. Next, you’ll learn how to implement an object-relational mapper using SQLAlchemy, the Python SQL toolkit. Finally, you’ll start interacting with your database from your Python program using this object-relational mapper. In the task, you’ll build your command line Recipe application in Python, putting together many of the concepts that you’ve learned throughout the Achievement.
