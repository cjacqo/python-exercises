1. In this exercise, you learned how to use if-elif-else statements to run different tasks based on conditions
   that you define. Now practice that skill by writing a script for a simple travel app using an if-elif-else
   statement for the following situation:

   * The script should ask the user where they want to travel
   * The user's input should be checked for 3 different travel destinations that you define
   * If the user's input is one of those 3 destinations, the following statement should be printed:
        "Enjoy your stay in ________!"
   * If the user's input is something other than the defined destinations, the following statement
     should be printed:
        "Oops, that destination is not currently available."

   - destination = input(print('Where would you like to travel to?'))
   - if (destination != 'Italy' or destination != 'New York' or destination != 'Canada'):
        print('Oops, that destination is not currently available.')
     else:
        print('Enjoy your stay in', destination + '!')

2. Imagine you're at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says, "Explain logical operators
   in Python". Draft how you would respond.

   - Logical operators are 'and', 'or', and 'not'. You can use them to check if certain conditions are met
     before deciding the execution path your programs will follow.

3. What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

   - Functions are sets of instructions that process or manipulate your code in order to achieve certain things.
     They are useful when you find yourself repeating steps or operations. Making a custom function can condense
     these steps to save time.

4. In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 3 to set some goals for yourself
   while you complete this course. In preparation for your next mentor call, make some notes on how you've progressed towards
   your goals so far.

   - As of this moment, I have yet to take my learning beyond what the course has presented. Once I get a grasp on the basics
     I will then extend my learning to the items I have listed in the previous question, which are security practices, database
     connections and eventually, machine learning.
