1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
		- While frontend development focuses on the user interface (UI) and the code is executed on the client side, backend development focuses on the server-side logic as well as data management. If I were to be hired to work as a backend programmer, my focuses would include database management, server-side logic, API development, security and integration. It would be my duty to ensure that data is able to be accessed via the frontend code in a safe and meaningful manner.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)
	- I would make it clear that Python is easy to learn and understand. It is a high-level scripting language, just like JavaScript, in which commands are executed line by line via standardized syntax. Readability is helped by indentation to separate blocks of code. Like JavaScript, Python uses easily understandable keywords to make commands and perform tasks and also shares with JavaScript dynamic typing, an approach that allows variables to assume any kind of value without producing errors. Part of what makes Python so versatile though, is the number of open-source and proprietary packages at hand to suit whatever you are working on, but also comes with out-of-the-box essentials such as URL routing, form handling and validation, template engines, database connections and more. It offers an efficient development flow and has strong community support.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
		- My biggest goal would be to learn about how to securely and safely create efficient and effective database connections while maintaining web security. I would also like to learn more about how to use machine learning with Python and maybe some game development for fun. Right now, with my current knowledge, I see myself working as a frontend developer, but hopefully this course can help me broaden my choices for employment.
